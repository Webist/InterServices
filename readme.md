# DEPRECATED

This project is no longer subject to any further development.

### Working on a new project
Last two years much effort has been focused on improved Delivery Model in private space.

Some of the features of the new Delivery Model, with the name `Callable` are;
 + Delivery path resolve. 
   No routing as it known in the wild, instead hashed keyword for a callable, for instance a class file, matching.
 + A chosen development model, M.O.M.
   M.O.M stands for Machinery Object Model. It rejects for example abstract classes, exotic file usage.
 + Every delivery model is by default questionable by command-line interface 
   and directly implement-able by http-docs layer. 
   Technically speaking the model is an Entry-Govern-Service instead of Model-View-Controller.
   View, http-docs layer, do not extend or belong to the core, it is a wrapping layer. Just like a car-body wraps an engine.
 + Standarized input options (command-line input), and parameters (http request inputs).
   High discipline consistency everywhere. 
   For example an input option/parameter such as `limit` or in short `-l` is a convention that is nicely cleaned an available via Filter object.
