### Frameworks - Services

Business logic operations build, frameworks.  
Business rules, including workflow or a finite state machine, are managed   
by these framework objects to interact with (external) services.

Interactions are interfaced by operators followed by executing statements.
Examples of statements are well prepared and to-be-executed operations such as   
command, query, connection to a adapter, email content   
and other export-data to execute with the intent of delivery to external services.
