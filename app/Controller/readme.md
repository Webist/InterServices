### Controller env

Classes, called controller, of regular route destinations.

However the naming controller is not indicative, 
a controller is in essence an entry point abstraction layer of the application.  
By analogy, it is the project definition with different activities in it.

It is not a management layer.  
As a project, it hosts or uses the management layers such as InterActor, ViewModel 
to accept the request and response properly.
